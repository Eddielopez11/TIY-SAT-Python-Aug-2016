1) Make a directory in your home directory called "classmates"

2) Go into that directory, and for each of your classmates, create a file with their first name. (e.g. "sam.txt")

3) In each of those files, put:
    * Their full name
    * One of their favorite books
    * Their home town
    * Where they would live if they could live anywhere

So, sam.txt might look like:

```
Name: Sam Smith
Book: A Study in Scarlett
Home town: Scranton, PA
Dream town: Schenectady, NY
```

4) If you haven't already, go to https://github.com and create an account.

5) On slack, https://tiysasummer16.slack.com , send Robin a direct message with your github username.
