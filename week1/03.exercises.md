# Git and Github Exercise

Practice what you've learned about git and github.

## Easy Mode

Create a new repository and put something in it.

1. Create a new git repository in your home directory called "git_exercise".
2. Add a README.md file.
3. In README.md, write a sentence or two describing git and github in your own words.
4. Commit that change to the repository.

## Normal Mode

Connect the repository you just created to github by following these steps:

1. Visit the [new repository](https://github.com/new) page, and create a "git_exercise" repository.
    * Don't check the "Initialize this repository with a README" box
2. On your repository's Quick setup page, copy the url beginning with "git@github.com:", and paste it into this command: `git remote add origin <url goes here>`
3. Run `git remote -v` to verify the origin worked.
4. Run `git push -u origin master` to push your local changes.

## Hard Mode

Create and merge a pull request:

1. Create a new branch and switch to it.
2. Edit README.md, and add a sentence or two about how you feel about git and github.
3. Commit those changes to your branch, and push the branch to the github repository you set up in Normal Mode.
4. Create a pull request from the github web UI.
5. Look at the *diff* of changes in the github web UI.
6. Merge your pull request.
7. On your local machine, switch back to the *master* branch and pull the changes down from github.
