## Easy Mode
#
# 1. Create a tuple of the 7 "colors of the rainbow" (e.g. "red", "blue", "indigo") called "color_tuple".
# 2. Run these tests:

assert "red" in color_tuple
assert "indigo" in color_tuple
assert "pink" not in color_tuple

## Normal Mode
#
# Create a dictionary called 'color_dict' that maps the colors of the rainbow to the hex values used by CSS (e.g. "#a3ccdf").

# HINT: Google for the correct hex values.

# Run these tests to make sure your code works

assert "blue" in color_dict
assert "#" in color_dict['blue']
assert "periwinkle" not in color_dict
